# HII-CHI-Mistry

HII-CHI-Mistry is a collection of python subroutines aimed at the calculation of chemical abundances and physical properties using emission line fluxes from ionised gaseous nebulae. Main website of the code is available [here](https://www.iaa.csic.es/~epm/HII-CHI-mistry.html).

## Requirements

### Python Packages

HII-CHI-Mistry was written for [Python v.2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/), but since its latest versions it is also compatible with [Python v.3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). It requires the Python library [NumPy](https://numpy.org).

### Libraries

HII-CHI-Mistry uses grid of models (libraries) to perform the estimations. Each version of code has its own libraries, created from photoionization models computed with [Cloudy v.17](https://gitlab.nublado.org/cloudy/cloudy).

Most recent versions of the codes allow the user to introduce a different file. However, this file introduced must be located under the corresponding folder and with the proper format (see documentation for each code).

In any case, **defaults libraries must not be removed**.

<sup><a name="myfootnote7">7</a></sup> If oxygen abundances are unknown, HCm will estimate them.

The above emission lines must be reddening corrected. If no information exists about a certain column it must typed as zero or not introduced in the input file. If the error is not known or if it is not going to be taken into account in the calculations,  it is advisable not using MonteCarlo iterations at all. Regarding lines the routine will only provide a  solution if at least one low-to-high excitation is given (e.g. [NeII] and [NeIII] and/or [SIII] and [SIV]). If only two low-excitation or high-excitation lines  are given the program will provide 0 values in the results.

The output file is also a text format, named with the original name of the input file and followed by the extension "_HCm-Teff-IR-output.dat". The first columns will show the information provided in the input file. In case ID column is missing, the code will automatically assign a cardinal to each row. The last seven columns show:

- 'O/H' and 'eO/H': estimation or input value of the oxygen abundance 12+log(O/H) and its uncertainty.
- 'Teff' and 'eTeff': estimation of the effective temperature in K and its uncertainty.
- 'U' and 'eU': estimation of the ionisation parameter log(U) and its uncertainty.

## Non-interactive mode

The latest versions of the code allow the user to implement a non-interactive mode that allows the code to be implemented within any other python script. All the details in the selection of the model must be modified within the python script. For example, in the optical version the variables that must be modified are:

```python
#################################################
###### NON INTERACTIVE OR INTERACTIVE CODE ######
#################################################

interactive = True #Change this value to False to run the code in non-interactive mode

#Questions (inputs fromt terminal)
question1 = interactive #Question to select the grids of models
question2 = interactive #Question for the value of alphaOX (only required if "sed" is set to 3)
question3 = interactive #Question for the value of efrac (only required if "sed" is set to 3)
question4 = interactive #Question required to introduce a particular file by the user (only required if "sed" is set 4)
question6 = interactive #Question to use or not interpolation for the grids
question7 = interactive #Question regarding the constrain law to be assumed by the code
question8 = interactive #Question required to tntroduced a particular file by the user (only if "const" is set to 6)

#Set values to operate
if question1 == False:
   sed = 1 #Choose grid of model: (1) for POPSTAR models; (2) for BPASS models; (3) for AGN models; (4) models introduced by the user (will require file). Replace value for the given option
if question2 == False and sed == 3:
   alpha = 2 #Choose value of alpha_OX: (1) for alpha_OX = -0.8; (2) for alpha_OX = -1.2. Replace value with any of these options
if question3 == False and sed == 3:
   efrac = 1 #Choose value for the stopping criteria, i.e., the fraction of free electrons: (1) for efrac = 0.02; (2) for efrac = 0.98
if question4 == False and sed == 4:
   new_library = 'Name_of_the_file' #Introduced name of the file with the grids of models. It must be located under the folder "Libraries_ir"
if question6 == False:
   inter = 0 #Choose value to perform interpolation: (0) no interpolation; (1) interpolation.  Replace value for the given option
if question7 == False:
   const = 1 #Choose value for the constraint laws between O/H, N/O and U that must be assumed when the code does not have enough information: (1) constraints obtained for Star-Forming Galaxies; (2) constraints obtained for Extreme Emission Line Galaxies; (3) constraints between N/O and O/H obtained for AGNs, without restriction in the ionization parameter; (4) constraints between N/O and O/H obtained for AGNs, and log(U) > -2.5; (5) constraints between N/O and O/H obtained for AGNs, and log(U) < -2.5; (6) constraint law introduced by the user (will required a file).  Replace value for the given option
if question8 == False and const == 6:
   new_const = 'Name_of_the_file' #Introduced name of the file with the constraint laws. It must be located under the folder "Constraint"
```

A similar structure is presented in the rest of flavours of the code.
